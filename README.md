# IBM_CODING_ANSWERS
the code is related to a coding question that I saw in one I_B_M coding. the question goes like this:
A company is looking for using cloud services and they need the services for n days and they require c cores. The cloud company that is providing the services has m number of plans:
which is a m X 4 matrix where in each row [l1, r1, C, P] where l1 is the nth day and r1 is the mth day, C is the capacity that the cloud provider can provide for that days from l1 to r1.

Now the problem is to use the plans which will give us the least cost.
